# Problem Statement
Managing books in a small library becomes difficult when records are handled manually. Tasks like adding new books, checking availability, issuing books, and keeping track of returns often lead to mistakes and confusion. There is no quick way to find a book or know how many copies are left. To solve these issues, a simple and reliable system is needed that can store book information, update records instantly, and reduce manual effort.
# Scope of the Project

• View a complete list of books and their status
This project focuses only on console-based interaction and does not use databases or advanced GUI. It is designed for educational purposes and for small libraries where simple management is sufficient. The project covers essential features but does not include login, student records, or online services.
